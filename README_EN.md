## 📖 Learning Path

If you're new to Spring AI, we recommend starting with the [Spring AI Official Documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) to understand the framework's basic concepts and usage. Then you can practice through the various modules in this project to gradually deepen your understanding of the framework's core features.

**Recommended Learning Sequence**:
1. 📚 [Spring AI Official Documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) - Understand basic concepts
2. 💬 **spring-ai-chat** - Chat application development (essential starting point)
3. 🔧 **spring-ai-tool-calling** - Tool calling capabilities
4. 🧠 **spring-ai-vector** - Vector database integration
5. 🚀 **MCP/RAG/AGENT** - Advanced application patterns

👇Let's start the Spring AI journey below～

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ⚙️ Environment Requirements

| Dependency     | Version/Requirement           | Note                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| SpringBoot     | 3.3.6                         | -                           |
| Spring AI      | 1.0.0                         | -                           |
| JDK            | 21+                           | -                           |
| Maven          | 3.6+                          | Strongly recommend using mvnd instead of mvn |
| Docker         | (for running Milvus, Nacos, etc.) |                        |

### 1. 🧬 Clone Project

```bash
# Clone project to local
git clone https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary.git
# Enter project directory and compile
cd spring-ai-summary && mvn clean compile -DskipTests
```

> If you encounter slow Maven dependency downloads, try using domestic Maven mirror sources like Aliyun, Tsinghua University, etc. If you have any other issues during runtime, you can scan the QR code to join the WeChat group above for consultation and discussion～～～

### 2. 🛠️ Configure Environment Variables

For the `application.yml`/`application.properties` files in each module's resource folder, configure the corresponding API keys according to your needs. For example, the **spring-ai-chat-deepseek** module:

```properties
# because we do not use the OpenAI protocol
spring.ai.deepseek.api-key=${spring.ai.deepseek.api-key}
spring.ai.deepseek.base-url=https://api.deepseek.com
spring.ai.deepseek.chat.completions-path=/v1/chat/completions
spring.ai.deepseek.chat.options.model=deepseek-chat
```
Replace your `spring.ai.deepseek.api-key` with the actual API key to start running. For how to apply for API keys, you can visit the project [Wiki page](https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary/wiki).

> 💡 **Security Tip**: Use environment variables to store API keys to avoid code leakage. [API Key Application Guide](https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary/wiki)

### 3. ▶️ Run Examples

After completing the above steps, you can choose to run different example modules to experience Spring AI features. For example, start running the **spring-ai-chat-deepseek** module (specific port may vary according to your configuration):

```
If you see similar startup logs as above, congratulations, you've started successfully 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉....! You've opened the door to Spring AI, and you can now start exploring various functional modules. After startup, you can test using cUrl, HTTPie, or Postman and other tools.

```bash
curl localhost:8081/api/deepseek/chatWithMetric?userInput="Who are you?"
```
Results as follows:

**Success Indicator** 🎉: Seeing similar responses indicates successful operation!

![Running Results](docs/statics/chat-ds-metrics.png)

You can continue using the following requests to check Token usage:

```bash
# completion tokens
http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/ai.completion.tokens
# prompt tokens
http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/ai.prompt.tokens
# total tokens
http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/ai.total.tokens
```
Taking `ai.completion.tokens` as an example, the results are as follows:

```json
{
   "name": "ai.completion.tokens",
   "measurements": [
      {
         "statistic": "COUNT",
         "value": 34
      }
   ],
   "availableTags": []
}
```

**For usage methods and configurations of other modules, please check the [Wiki page](https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary/wiki) or each module's `README.md` file.**
